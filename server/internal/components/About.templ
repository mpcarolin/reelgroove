			For years, my partner and I struggled to decide a movie to watch on movie night.
			We'd flip through streaming services and movie lists, only to end up
			with dozens of choices, dozens more reviews of varying quality, and no closer to a decision.
		</p>
		<p>
			One day, we went to a movie theater. As we watched the previews, I noticed how
			easy it was for my wife and I to come to agree on movies we wanted to watch together in the future.
			There were no distractions. No reviews to read, no ratings or comments to bias you in one direction or another.
			We were able to make a choice based on a <b>curated</b> set of <b>a handful of</b> trailers in front of us, simple as that.
		</p>
		<p>
			I wondered why we couldn't have a similar experience at home.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, Cinematch was born.
		</p>
		<p>
			The best part?
			It's free. <small>(...though donations are appreciated ðŸ™‚)</small>
