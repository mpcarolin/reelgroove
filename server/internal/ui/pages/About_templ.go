As we watched the previews, I noticed how easy it was for my wife and I to come to agree on movies we wanted to watch together in the future. There were no distractions. No reviews to read, no ratings or comments to bias you in one direction or another. We were able to make a choice based on a <b>curated</b> set of <b>a handful of</b> trailers in front of us, simple as that.</p><p>I wondered why we couldn't have a similar experience at home.</p><p>So, Cinematch was born.</p><p>The best part?
